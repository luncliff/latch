 * A `latch` is a thread coordination mechanism that allows any number of threads
 * to block until an expected number of threads arrive at the `latch`
 * (via the `count_down` function).
 *
 * The expected count is set when the `latch` is created.
 * An individual `latch` is a single-use object;
 * once the expected count has been reached, the `latch` cannot be reused.
